	<h1>About Homies</h1>
	<p>Homies is an online system that makes sharing a house easier! Forget the problems of who owes who what, do I need to set the alarm? Do we need milk or not? All of these issues can now be kept track of and stored in one place. If you're at the shop and dont know if you need milk or not, just log into Homies and voil√†! Yes you do. Homies helps you to keep track of all of these simple things that are usually spread over many group chats and hidden in random messages. </p>
