# first_group_project 2019-2020

Homies is an online system that makes sharing a house easier! Forget the problems of who owes who what,
do I need to set the alarm? Do we need milk or not? All of these issues can now be kept track of and stored in one place. 
If you're at the shop and don't know if you need milk or not, just log into Homies and voil√†! Yes you do.
Homies help you to keep track of all of these simple things that are usually spread over many group chats and hidden in random messages.

Homies was our group project for the first year in the University of Manchester.
It was completed by myself and 5 other computer science students.
